In this code we created a function called 'strFunction' with its parameter 'str' Inside the function we defined an array of 'vowels' and 'count' variables assigned value 0, then we used the 'toLowerCase()' to ignore the string case sensitivity the using 'for.. of' loop to loop through the string character and suing 'includes()' method to count only those words that included in the 'vowels' array. finally, we return the 'count' and print the included vowel character in the string.
